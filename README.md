# CDPC Application

## Project Overview

Welcome to the CDPC (Career Development and Placement Cell) Application repository! This project was developed during my summer internship at CHARUSAT, with the goal of revolutionizing how students connect with potential employers. Our application streamlines CDPC's operations and serves as a bridge between students and industry.

## Introduction

As part of a passionate team at CHARUSAT, I embarked on a transformative journey to develop a comprehensive application for CDPC. Our mission was clear: to create a platform that would bridge the gap between academia and industry, enhancing the career prospects of countless students.

## Tech Stack

We built this application using the following technologies:

- **Flutter**: For cross-platform mobile app development.
- **Next.js**: For a lightning-fast web portal experience.
- **Node.js**: For robust server-side operations.
- **MongoDB**: For flexible and efficient data storage.

Our development toolkit also included VS Code as our code editor and Git for version control and collaboration.

## Features

Our application boasts several exciting features:

- **Automated Notifications**: Keeps students informed about new opportunities.
- **Real-Time Analytics Dashboard**: Facilitates data-driven decision-making.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works smoothly with existing CDPC systems.

Each feature was carefully crafted to improve user experience and operational efficiency.
